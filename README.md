# AI-In-Aviation-Industry

For the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) have dominated conversations in the tech world. 
This emerging technology is considered part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
This is transforming every industry in one form or another and aviation is no exception.
Today AI is reshaping both the technological and human aspects of aviation.


## Applications of AI in the Aviation Industry:

### Ticketing Systems

Factors like flight distance, competition, purchase date, seasonality, oil price, airline reputation and more, 
influence airline ticket pricing. The airline fare market is almost as complex as the financial market.
Naturally, it’s a great candidate for AI-based algorithms to optimise price points to provide better revenue management.
AI is helping the aviation industry implement models like expected marginal seat revenue (EMSR) and
ancillary price optimisation. It is helping the industry save money while providing better service to customers.


### Flight Maintenance

Aircraft maintenance is a complicated affair. Airplanes are always on the move around the world and the 
mechanical parts are not easy to move around. Consequently, airlines have to meticulously plan their maintenance schedules.
Any unplanned maintenance can result in flight cancellations and delays which are expensive. 
This has led airlines to use AI-based predictive analytics to determine the maintenance needs of various parts of an aircraft.
These tools can predict failure before it happens. It can save millions for the aviation industry.
Delta is already using predictive maintenance to decrease flight cancellations. Moreover,
AI-based tools are helping ground maintenance crew with repairs.


### Fuel Efficiency

Jet fuel is one of the largest operational costs for an airline company.
Also, airplanes produce 2 percent of the total human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. 
Thus, decreasing fuel wastage is a vital objective for the aviation industry. 
Fuel load contributes to the usage and affects the bottom line, so carrying the optimal amount improves efficiency. 
Airlines can use machine learning algorithms to collect and analyse data about aircraft weights, flight routes, 
distances, altitudes, number of passengers and more. This can help airlines determine the optimum amount of fuel
necessary for each flight. Airlines are already taking steps. 
For example, Southwest has partnered with GE Aviation Digital Solutions to use big data an AI to save $100 million on fuel.


### Crew Management

The aviation industry is reliant on a complex network of people working together. 
Missing crew members, including pilots, flight attendants and engineers, can have ripple effects. 
Rescheduling a crew member isn’t simple. Numerous factors like qualifications, certificates, availability, 
and scheduling conflicts need to be resolved. This can be solved by utilising machine learning systems. 
Jeppesen is an example of an AI-based crew rostering system that is 
helping the industry better manage their crew assignments.


## Conclusion

It is surprising that a sector as important as aviation has woken up to AI so late. As AI in aviation picks up its pace, there could probably be a few mergers, acquisitions or even closure of small airlines which will not be able to afford the investments. Now, AI seems the best option to take aviation to the next level.
