# AI-In-Aviation-Industry

The global aviation industry has been growing exponentially. Take the example of the U.S. commercial aviation industry: In the next two decades, passenger count is expected to double. In 2016, the U.S. commercial aviation industry generated an operating revenue of $168.2 billion. This is an opportunity for exponential growth which needs to be handled well. The aviation industry needs to move beyond its present ways of working and find better ways to optimize resources, improve customer satisfaction and safety records, control costs and be more responsible environmentally. Data is key to unlocking the potential, and the aviation industry must leverage AI. 


### Few words about AI...

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.

For the past few years, AI have dominated conversations in the tech world. 
This emerging technology is considered part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
It is transforming every industry in one form or another and aviation is no exception.
So, while today AI is reshaping both the technological and human aspects of aviation, we need to discuss the use cases being implemented currently.



## Applications of AI in the Aviation Industry:

### Ticketing Systems

Factors like flight distance, competition, purchase date, seasonality, oil price, airline reputation and more, 
influence airline ticket pricing. The airline fare market is almost as complex as the financial market.
Naturally, it’s a great candidate for AI-based algorithms to optimise price points to provide better revenue management.
AI is helping the aviation industry implement models like expected marginal seat revenue (EMSR) and
ancillary price optimisation. It is helping the industry save money while providing better service to customers.


### Flight Maintenance

Aircraft maintenance is a complicated affair. Airplanes are always on the move around the world and the 
mechanical parts are not easy to move around. Consequently, airlines have to meticulously plan their maintenance schedules.
Any unplanned maintenance can result in flight cancellations and delays which are expensive. 
This has led airlines to use AI-based predictive analytics to determine the maintenance needs of various parts of an aircraft.
These tools can predict failure before it happens. It can save millions for the aviation industry.
Delta Airlines Compony is already using predictive maintenance to decrease flight cancellations. Moreover,
AI-based tools are helping ground maintenance crew with repairs. 


### Avoidance Systems

TCAS - traffic collision avoidance system, on-board system that predicts collisions that may accure a few seconds
before accident. And it's priority is higher than the air-traffic controller's. 

MTCD - medium term conflict detection, air-traffic controller system, which helps to avoid conflicts in advance.


### Fuel Efficiency

Jet fuel is one of the largest operational costs for an airline company.
Also, airplanes produce 2 percent of the total human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. 
Thus, decreasing fuel wastage is a vital objective for the aviation industry. 
Fuel load contributes to the usage and affects the bottom line, so carrying the optimal amount improves efficiency. 
Airlines can use machine learning algorithms to collect and analyse data about aircraft weights, flight routes, 
distances, altitudes, number of passengers and more. This can help airlines determine the optimum amount of fuel
necessary for each flight. Airlines are already taking steps. 
For example, Southwest has partnered with GE Aviation Digital Solutions to use big data an AI to save $100 million on fuel.


### Crew Management

The aviation industry is reliant on a complex network of people working together. 
Missing crew members, including pilots, flight attendants and engineers, can have ripple effects. 
Rescheduling a crew member isn’t simple. Numerous factors like qualifications, certificates, availability, 
and scheduling conflicts need to be resolved. This can be solved by utilising machine learning systems. 
Jeppesen Air-Navigation System's Company (U.S) is an example of an AI-based crew rostering system that is 
helping the industry better manage their crew assignments.


## AI vs Mankind 


However, one of the most challenging issue is whether AI can replace pilot or air-traffic controller.
Let us begin with history... In 1947 american military aircraft Douglas C-54 Skymaster crossed the Atlantic Ocean 
in automatic mode. Then, in 1989 the orbital ship "Buran" performed an automatic landing. As we can see 
the basic AI systems appeared almost half a centure ago. But for some reasons, we can't see absolutely automated
aircrafts today. So, what's the problem behind?

In the sky sometimes there're abnormal situations, and in this case, the creative human nature and the ability to
think outside the box take over the racionality of AI. If we want to replace the air-traffic controller 
there're even more difficulties. For example, he must recognize different languages and accents. 
Yet, we can't implement full speech recognition in AI. Moreover, the communication channel is constructed so
that air-traffic controller speaks, pilot listen, AI can't speak. So it will send text data, but pilot can't
be distracted. And we don't even speak about economic part. Increase in efficiency may be small, but it will
lead to enormous ticket price.




## Conclusion

It is surprising that a sector as important as aviation has woken up to AI so late. As AI in aviation picks up its pace, there could probably be a few mergers, acquisitions or even closure of small airlines which will not be able to afford the investments. Now, AI seems the best option to take aviation to the next level.
